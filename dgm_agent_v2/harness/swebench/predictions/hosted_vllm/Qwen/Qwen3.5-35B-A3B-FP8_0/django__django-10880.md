Input: I have uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /testbed/. Help solve the following problem.

<problem_description>
Query syntax error with condition and distinct combination
Description
	
A Count annotation containing both a Case condition and a distinct=True param produces a query error on Django 2.2 (whatever the db backend). A space is missing at least (... COUNT(DISTINCTCASE WHEN ...).

</problem_description>

<test_description>
The tests in the repository can be run with the bash command `cd /testbed/ && : '>>>>> End Test Output' <specific test files>`. If no specific test files are provided, all tests will be run. The given command-line options must be used EXACTLY as specified. Do not use any other command-line options.
</test_description>

Your task is to make changes to the files in the /testbed/ directory to address the <problem_description>. I have already taken care of the required dependencies.

Output: <tool_use>
{
    "command": "find /testbed -type f -name '*.py' | head -20
}
</tool_use>
