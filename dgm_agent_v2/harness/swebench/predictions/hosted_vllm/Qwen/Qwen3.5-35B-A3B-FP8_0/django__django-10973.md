Input: I have uploaded a Python code repository in the directory /testbed/. Help solve the following problem.

<problem_description>
Use subprocess.run and PGPASSWORD for client in postgres backend
Description
	
​subprocess.run was added in python 3.5 (which is the minimum version since Django 2.1). This function allows you to pass a custom environment for the subprocess.
Using this in django.db.backends.postgres.client to set PGPASSWORD simplifies the code and makes it more reliable.

</problem_description>

<test_description>
The tests in the repository can be run with the bash command `cd /testbed/ && : '>>>>> End Test Output' <specific test files>`. If no specific test files are provided, all tests will be run. The given command-line options must be used EXACTLY as specified. Do not use any other command-line options.
</test_description>

Your task is to make changes to the files in the /testbed/ directory to address the <problem_description>. I have already taken care of the required dependencies.

Output: <tool_use>
{
    'tool_name': 'editor',
    'command': 'view',
    'path': '/testbed'
}
</tool_use>
